      <description>0x00 Well done agents! The mission is now over! I repeat: The mission is now over!
 If you are not familiar with missions - they are CTF-like challenges or code golfs published at the end of the Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s livestream. Mission number 25 was pretty special. It was brought to us by firemark, whom you might recall from our IRC channel
The task was to create a bot firmware (probably simplyfied AI program) and win THEEEEEE BIIIIIIIG BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BATTLE!</description>
