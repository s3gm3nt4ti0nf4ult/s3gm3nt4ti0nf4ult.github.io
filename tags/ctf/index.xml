The task was simple - RCE via Unrestricted File Upload. The uploaded file must be the .jpeg one, so sanitization mechanism has to be bypassed.
0x01 Solution To get access to the upload page the id parameter is needed in the GET request.
GET /uploads/?id=ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.52.175 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Then there is a service to upload images of suspicious peoples hanging around.</description></item><item><title>Advent of Cyber2 Day 0x01</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/12/advent-of-cyber2-day-0x01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 18:38:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/12/advent-of-cyber2-day-0x01/</guid><description>0x00 Ho! Ho! Ho! December 1, the day on which the countdown begins. We don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to help our Santa deliver malicious payl^W pardon, I should talk about Santa in the red uniform not about red teaming. So as one may read, it&amp;rsquo;s only 24 days until Christmas and crackers/APTs/state actors are trying to ruin Christmas. This challenge was brought to you by John Hammond and I would consider it as easy one.</description></item><item><title>Battle City Mission Winner Announcement</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2019/01/battle-city-mission-winner-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 10:55:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2019/01/battle-city-mission-winner-announcement/</guid><description>0x00 Well done agents! The mission is now over! I repeat: The mission is now over!
If you are not familiar with missions - they are CTF-like challenges or code golfs published at the end of the Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s livestream. Mission number 25 was pretty special. It was brought to us by firemark, whom you might recall from our IRC channel
The task was to create a bot firmware (probably simplyfied AI program) and win THEEEEEE BIIIIIIIG BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BATTLE!</description></item><item><title>EN: Hacking VulnHub Machine - Pinky's Palace I</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2018/07/en-hacking-vulnhub-machine-pinkys-palace-i/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:36:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2018/07/en-hacking-vulnhub-machine-pinkys-palace-i/</guid><description>**But we are Poles and we are not afraid of dictionary attacks** A funny quote from the Internet 0x00 Gooood moooornnnnin&amp;rsquo; Internetnam! After a looooong time, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to spend some time on writing. There is more to go, but for now - let&amp;rsquo;s dive into VulnHub VM - our target today is a well known Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace I by Pink_Panther.
By the way I also recommend his OSCP failing post, that shows why failing is not the end of the world, but the beginning of the journey!</description></item><item><title>EN: Gynvael's Mission 016</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/10/en-gynvaels-mission-016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 12:23:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/10/en-gynvaels-mission-016/</guid><description>My task I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to accomplish mission no. 016 (in decimal), because I&amp;rsquo;m an author of this mess ;) So in this post I will show &amp;ldquo;my intended solution&amp;rdquo;. Before we begin, I want to give a huge shoutout to my IRC mate, who have told me a lot about a SSTV and a ham radio. This inspired me to create this mission. Kudos to @fishcake! The rating of this mission was done by @Gynvael.</description></item></channel></rss>
