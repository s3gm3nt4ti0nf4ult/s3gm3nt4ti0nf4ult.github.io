The mission is now over! I repeat: The mission is now over!
If you are not familiar with missions - they are CTF-like challenges or code golfs published at the end of the Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s livestream. Mission number 25 was pretty special. It was brought to us by firemark, whom you might recall from our IRC channel
The task was to create a bot firmware (probably simplyfied AI program) and win THEEEEEE BIIIIIIIG BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BATTLE!</description></item><item><title>EN: Gynvael's Mission 016</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/10/en-gynvaels-mission-016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 12:23:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/10/en-gynvaels-mission-016/</guid><description>My task I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to accomplish mission no. 016 (in decimal), because I&amp;rsquo;m an author of this mess ;) So in this post I will show &amp;ldquo;my intended solution&amp;rdquo;. Before we begin, I want to give a huge shoutout to my IRC mate, who have told me a lot about a SSTV and a ham radio. This inspired me to create this mission. Kudos to @fishcake! The rating of this mission was done by @Gynvael.</description></item></channel></rss>
