The task was simple - RCE via Unrestricted File Upload. The uploaded file must be the .jpeg one, so sanitization mechanism has to be bypassed.
0x01 Solution To get access to the upload page the id parameter is needed in the GET request.
GET /uploads/?id=ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.52.175 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Then there is a service to upload images of suspicious peoples hanging around.</description></item><item><title>Advent of Cyber2 Day 0x01</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/12/advent-of-cyber2-day-0x01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 18:38:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/12/advent-of-cyber2-day-0x01/</guid><description>0x00 Ho! Ho! Ho! December 1, the day on which the countdown begins. We don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to help our Santa deliver malicious payl^W pardon, I should talk about Santa in the red uniform not about red teaming. So as one may read, it&amp;rsquo;s only 24 days until Christmas and crackers/APTs/state actors are trying to ruin Christmas. This challenge was brought to you by John Hammond and I would consider it as easy one.</description></item><item><title>[HTB Writeup]: Openadmin HackTheBox Challenge</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/08/htb-writeup-openadmin-hackthebox-challenge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 17:54:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/08/htb-writeup-openadmin-hackthebox-challenge/</guid><description>&amp;lt;disclaimer&amp;gt;this is an old post, that was finished some time ago (February 2020), but due to the things (I forgot about retiring the machine) I&amp;rsquo;m publishing it now&amp;lt;/disclaimer&amp;gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s been a looooong time&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; since I&amp;rsquo;ve written something here. This place is not dead yet. I had really tight schedule with my security job, school, CTFs and PozSec meetups organization soooo it was really hard to start blogging again. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning so some topics I want to cover in depth require some time.</description></item><item><title>Gynvael's Challenges 0, 1 and 2</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/05/gynvaels-challenges-0-1-and-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 11:29:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2020/05/gynvaels-challenges-0-1-and-2/</guid><description>0x00 Introduction If you have ever wondered why I am foxtrot_charlie, well - first of all my parents gave me this name, and then cf acronym comes to play. In military jargon cf could be described visually as the beginning of the year 2020. Pure cluster f***k. But lockdown has some advantages. For example I do not need to move around for my uni classes (why the hell something like that must have happened so we could study at home) so there is plenty of time to do my thing - hack.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 19:49:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/about/</guid><description>Hi!

The mission is now over! I repeat: The mission is now over!
If you are not familiar with missions - they are CTF-like challenges or code golfs published at the end of the Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s livestream. Mission number 25 was pretty special. It was brought to us by firemark, whom you might recall from our IRC channel
The task was to create a bot firmware (probably simplyfied AI program) and win THEEEEEE BIIIIIIIG BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BATTLE!</description></item><item><title>EN: Hacking VulnHub Machine - Pinky's Palace I</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2018/07/en-hacking-vulnhub-machine-pinkys-palace-i/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:36:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2018/07/en-hacking-vulnhub-machine-pinkys-palace-i/</guid><description>**But we are Poles and we are not afraid of dictionary attacks** A funny quote from the Internet 0x00 Gooood moooornnnnin&amp;rsquo; Internetnam! After a looooong time, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to spend some time on writing. There is more to go, but for now - let&amp;rsquo;s dive into VulnHub VM - our target today is a well known Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace I by Pink_Panther.
By the way I also recommend his OSCP failing post, that shows why failing is not the end of the world, but the beginning of the journey!</description></item><item><title>EN: Gynvael's Mission 016</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/10/en-gynvaels-mission-016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 12:23:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/10/en-gynvaels-mission-016/</guid><description>My task I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to accomplish mission no. 016 (in decimal), because I&amp;rsquo;m an author of this mess ;) So in this post I will show &amp;ldquo;my intended solution&amp;rdquo;. Before we begin, I want to give a huge shoutout to my IRC mate, who have told me a lot about a SSTV and a ham radio. This inspired me to create this mission. Kudos to @fishcake! The rating of this mission was done by @Gynvael.</description></item><item><title>EN: Gynvaels Mission EN015</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/09/en-gynvaels-mission-en015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2017 11:19:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/09/en-gynvaels-mission-en015/</guid><description>Task A stream number 34 was about implementing some basic stuff of a CHIP-8 virtual machine.

The vulnerability itself is quite amusing, as it allows to leak any file on the FS in form of a bar chart.</description></item><item><title>EN: Gynvael's Mission EN009 &amp;&amp; radare2 struggle</title><link>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/07/en-gynvaels-mission-en009-radare2-struggle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2017 12:34:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foxtrotlabs.cc/2017/07/en-gynvaels-mission-en009-radare2-struggle/</guid><description>So this is the way blogging looks like&amp;hellip; :)
0x00: MISSION 009 AGENDA If you are watching Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s EN streams, you know what it&amp;rsquo;s all about. After every stream, Gynvael is publishing one mission aka easy CTF task. And here is my &amp;ldquo;writeup-wannabe&amp;rdquo; for challenge number 009. Honestly that was the hardest challenge made by Gynvael. I love it, and wait for more!
TASK: Welcome back agent 1336. No mail.</description></item></channel></rss>
