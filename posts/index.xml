      <description>0x00 Introduction If you have ever wondered why I am foxtrot_charlie, well - first of all my parents gave me this name, and then cf acronym comes to play. In military jargon cf could be described visually as the beginning of the year 2020. Pure cluster f***k. But lockdown has some advantages. For example I do not need to move around for my uni classes (why the hell something like that must have happened so we could study at home) so there is plenty of time to do my thing - hack.</description>

      <description>0x00 Well done agents! The mission is now over! I repeat: The mission is now over!
 If you are not familiar with missions - they are CTF-like challenges or code golfs published at the end of the Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s livestream. Mission number 25 was pretty special. It was brought to us by firemark, whom you might recall from our IRC channel
The task was to create a bot firmware (probably simplyfied AI program) and win THEEEEEE BIIIIIIIG BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BATTLE!</description>

      <description>**But we are Poles and we are not afraid of dictionary attacks** A funny quote from the Internet  0x00 Gooood moooornnnnin&amp;rsquo; Internetnam! After a looooong time, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to spend some time on writing. There is more to go, but for now - let&amp;rsquo;s dive into VulnHub VM - our target today is a well known Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace I by Pink_Panther.
By the way I also recommend his OSCP failing post, that shows why failing is not the end of the world, but the beginning of the journey!</description>

      <description>My task I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to accomplish mission no. 016 (in decimal), because I&amp;rsquo;m an author of this mess ;) So in this post I will show &amp;ldquo;my intended solution&amp;rdquo;. Before we begin, I want to give a huge shoutout to my IRC mate, who have told me a lot about a SSTV and a ham radio. This inspired me to create this mission. Kudos to @fishcake! The rating of this mission was done by @Gynvael.</description>

      <description>Task A stream number 34 was about implementing some basic stuff of a CHIP-8 virtual machine. The ending screen contains ofcoruse a mission!
MISSION 015 goo.gl/JKN1Zq DIFFICULTY: █████░░░░░ [5╱10] ┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅ One of our operatives managed to find an information leak vulnerability on an internal website of a hostile syndicate. The vulnerability itself is quite amusing, as it allows to leak any file on the FS in form of a bar chart.</description>

      <description>So this is the way blogging looks like&amp;hellip; :)
 0x00: MISSION 009 AGENDA If you are watching Gynvael&amp;rsquo;s EN streams, you know what it&amp;rsquo;s all about. After every stream, Gynvael is publishing one mission aka easy CTF task. And here is my &amp;ldquo;writeup-wannabe&amp;rdquo; for challenge number 009. Honestly that was the hardest challenge made by Gynvael. I love it, and wait for more!
TASK: Welcome back agent 1336. No mail.</description>
